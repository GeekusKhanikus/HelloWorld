# 

# datacamp.com - enrolled in the "Data scientist with R" using my personal email, not my student one.
# enki - android app (it's actually kinda helpul to morons such as myself).
# The shapes of clouds to predict the future of predictive algorithms... but not really.

#- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on** ... 
# being better at life in general, imaginary friend generators &/or offering new / improved personalities to those in need. 
# Failing that - anything relating to vertical farming, aquaculture (algae, fish), autonomous agriculture

#- 📫 How to reach me ... well, as telepathy still isn't feasible technologically speaking... 
# Do try reaching out to me here, or find me on LinkedIn.
