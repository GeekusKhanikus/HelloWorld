# I'm learning R for data science in my own time using the following resources:

# R Markdown: The Definitive Guide - https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/

# 

# datacamp.com - enrolled in the "Data scientist with R" using my personal email, not my student one.
# enki - android app (it's actually kinda helpul to morons such as myself).
# The shapes of clouds to predict the future of predictive algorithms... but not really.

#- üíûÔ∏è **I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on** ... 
# being better at life in general, imaginary friend generators &/or offering new / improved personalities to those in need. 
# Failing that - anything relating to vertical farming, aquaculture (algae, fish), autonomous agriculture

#- üì´ How to reach me ... well, as telepathy still isn't feasible technologically speaking... 
# Do try reaching out to me here, or find me on LinkedIn.

#- üëÄ About this individual:  Human, Male.

# Has been known to be outsmarted by women, cats, small wild birds who make it indoors, 
# buttons labeled "Do not push this button"... and the occasional goldfish.

# Likes: Breathing, Coffee, Music, Science** and Sleeping.
# (Alphabetically, not in order of preference)
# Dislikes: Infectious pathogens, global pandemics and people who laugh when saying:
                    "What could possibly go wrong?"
# ** Science - as in all of it, you know... life, the universe... everything***. 
# *** Except for politics, religion, "corporate ethics" and economic theory.
#       - they just confuse the heck out of me.

# Favorite quotes:

# Pinky: Gee, Brain, what do you want to do tonight?
# Brain: The same thing we do every night, Pinky - try to take over the world!
# xkcd.com/267:
#              "Remember that you are always
#                      making up the future as you go."
# Bruce Lee:
#          "Mistakes are always forgivable,
#                 if one has the courage to admit them."

# xkcd.com/150:
#        "Because we're grownups now
#  and it's our turn to decide what that means."

# Bruce Lee (again):
#                "Adapt what is useful,
#                   reject what is useless,
#        and add what is specifically your own."


# xkcd.com/154/:
#             "The universe doesn't care what you believe.
#                 The wonderful thing about science is that
#                     it doesn't ask for your faith,
#                       it just asks for your eyes."

# Another B.L. :
#          "If you spend too much time thinking about a[ny]thing,
#                             you'll never get it done."
